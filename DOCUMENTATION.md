# Getting started

The MessageMedia Messages API provides a number of endpoints for building powerful two-way messaging applications.

## How to Build

The generated code has dependencies over external libraries like UniRest. These dependencies are defined in the ```composer.json``` file that comes with the SDK. 
To resolve these dependencies, we use the Composer package manager which requires PHP greater than 5.3.2 installed in your system. 
Visit [https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/) to download the installer file for Composer and run it in your system. 
Open command prompt and type ```composer --version```. This should display the current version of the Composer installed if the installation was successful.

* Using command line, navigate to the directory containing the generated files (including ```composer.json```) for the SDK. 
* Run the command ```composer install```. This should install all the required dependencies and create the ```vendor``` directory in your project directory.

![Building SDK - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?step=installDependencies&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-PHP)

### [For Windows Users Only] Configuring CURL Certificate Path in php.ini

CURL used to include a list of accepted CAs, but no longer bundles ANY CA certs. So by default it will reject all SSL certificates as unverifiable. You will have to get your CA's cert and point curl at it. The steps are as follows:

1. Download the certificate bundle (.pem file) from [https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html) on to your system.
2. Add curl.cainfo = "PATH_TO/cacert.pem" to your php.ini file located in your php installation. “PATH_TO” must be an absolute path containing the .pem file.

```ini
[curl]
; A default value for the CURLOPT_CAINFO option. This is required to be an
; absolute path.
;curl.cainfo =
```

## How to Use

The following section explains how to use the MessageMediaMessages library in a new project.

### 1. Open Project in an IDE

Open an IDE for PHP like PhpStorm. The basic workflow presented here is also applicable if you prefer using a different editor or IDE.

![Open project in PHPStorm - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?step=openIDE&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-PHP)

Click on ```Open``` in PhpStorm to browse to your generated SDK directory and then click ```OK```.

![Open project in PHPStorm - Step 2](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?step=openProject0&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-PHP)     

### 2. Add a new Test Project

Create a new directory by right clicking on the solution name as shown below:

![Add a new project in PHPStorm - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?step=createDirectory&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-PHP)

Name the directory as "test"

![Add a new project in PHPStorm - Step 2](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?step=nameDirectory&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-PHP)
   
Add a PHP file to this project

![Add a new project in PHPStorm - Step 3](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?step=createFile&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-PHP)

Name it "testSDK"

![Add a new project in PHPStorm - Step 4](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?step=nameFile&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-PHP)

Depending on your project setup, you might need to include composer's autoloader in your PHP code to enable auto loading of classes.

```PHP
require_once "../vendor/autoload.php";
```

It is important that the path inside require_once correctly points to the file ```autoload.php``` inside the vendor directory created during dependency installations.

![Add a new project in PHPStorm - Step 4](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?step=projectFiles&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-PHP)

After this you can add code to initialize the client library and acquire the instance of a Controller class. Sample code to initialize the client library and using controller methods is given in the subsequent sections.

### 3. Run the Test Project

To run your project you must set the Interpreter for your project. Interpreter is the PHP engine installed on your computer.

Open ```Settings``` from ```File``` menu.

![Run Test Project - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?step=openSettings&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-PHP)

Select ```PHP``` from within ```Languages & Frameworks```

![Run Test Project - Step 2](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?step=setInterpreter0&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-PHP)

Browse for Interpreters near the ```Interpreter``` option and choose your interpreter.

![Run Test Project - Step 3](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?step=setInterpreter1&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-PHP)

Once the interpreter is selected, click ```OK```

![Run Test Project - Step 4](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?step=setInterpreter2&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-PHP)

To run your project, right click on your PHP file inside your Test project and click on ```Run```

![Run Test Project - Step 5](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?step=runProject&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-PHP)

## How to Test

Unit tests in this SDK can be run using PHPUnit. 

1. First install the dependencies using composer including the `require-dev` dependencies.
2. Run `vendor\bin\phpunit --verbose` from commandline to execute tests. If you have 
   installed PHPUnit globally, run tests using `phpunit --verbose` instead.

You can change the PHPUnit test configuration in the `phpunit.xml` file.

## Initialization

### Authentication
In order to setup authentication and initialization of the API client, you need the following information.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| basicAuthUserName | The username to use with basic authentication |
| basicAuthPassword | The password to use with basic authentication |



API client can be initialized as following.

```php
$basicAuthUserName = 'basicAuthUserName'; // The username to use with basic authentication
$basicAuthPassword = 'basicAuthPassword'; // The password to use with basic authentication

$client = new MessageMediaMessagesLib\MessageMediaMessagesClient($basicAuthUserName, $basicAuthPassword);
```

### <a name="send_messages"></a>![Method: ](https://apidocs.io/img/method.png ".MessagesController.sendMessages") sendMessages

> Submit one or more (up to 100 per request) SMS, MMS or text to voice messages for delivery.
> The most basic message has the following structure:
> ```json
> {
>     "messages": [
>         {
>             "content": "My first message!",
>             "destination_number": "+61491570156"
>         }
>     ]
> }
> ```
> More advanced delivery features can be specified by setting the following properties in a message:
> - ```callback_url``` A URL can be included with each message to which Webhooks will be pushed to
>   via a HTTP POST request. Webhooks will be sent if and when the status of the message changes as
>   it is processed (if the delivery report property of the request is set to ```true```) and when replies
>   are received. Specifying a callback URL is optional.
> - ```content``` The content of the message. This can be a Unicode string, up to 5,000 characters long.
>   Message content is required.
> - ```delivery_report``` Delivery reports can be requested with each message. If delivery reports are requested, a webhook
>   will be submitted to the ```callback_url``` property specified for the message (or to the webhooks)
>   specified for the account every time the status of the message changes as it is processed. The
>   current status of the message can also be retrieved via the Delivery Reports endpoint of the
>   Messages API. Delivery reports are optional and by default will not be requested.
> - ```destination_number``` The destination number the message should be delivered to. This should be specified in E.164
>   international format. For information on E.164, please refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164.
>   A destination number is required.
> - ```format``` The format specifies which format the message will be sent as, ```SMS``` (text message), ```MMS``` (multimedia message)
>   or ```TTS``` (text to speech). With ```TTS``` format, we will call the destination number and read out the
>   message using a computer generated voice. Specifying a format is optional, by default ```SMS``` will be used.
> - ```source_number``` A source number may be specified for the message, this will be the number that
>   the message appears from on the handset. By default this feature is _not_ available and will be ignored
>   in the request. Please contact <support@messagemedia.com> for more information. Specifying a source
>   number is optional and a by default a source number will be assigned to the message.
> - ```media``` The media is used to specify the url of the media file that you are trying to send. Supported file formats include png, jpeg and gif. ```format``` parameter must be set to ```MMS``` for this to work.
> - ```subject``` The subject field is used to denote subject of the MMS message and has a maximum size of 64 characters long. Specifying a subject is optional.
> - ```source_number_type``` If a source number is specified, the type of source number may also be
>   specified. This is recommended when using a source address type that is not an internationally
>   formatted number, available options are ```INTERNATIONAL```, ```ALPHANUMERIC``` or ```SHORTCODE```. Specifying a
>   source number type is only valid when the ```source_number``` parameter is specified and is optional.
>   If a source number is specified and no source number type is specified, the source number type will be
>   inferred from the source number, however this may be inaccurate.
> - ```scheduled``` A message can be scheduled for delivery in the future by setting the scheduled property.
>   The scheduled property expects a date time specified in ISO 8601 format. The scheduled time must be
>   provided in UTC and is optional. If no scheduled property is set, the message will be delivered immediately.
> - ```message_expiry_timestamp``` A message expiry timestamp can be provided to specify the latest time
>   at which the message should be delivered. If the message cannot be delivered before the specified
>   message expiry timestamp elapses, the message will be discarded. Specifying a message expiry 
>   timestamp is optional.
> - ```metadata``` Metadata can be included with the message which will then be included with any delivery
>   reports or replies matched to the message. This can be used to create powerful two-way messaging
>   applications without having to store persistent data in the application. Up to 10 key / value metadata data
>   pairs can be specified in a message. Each key can be up to 100 characters long, and each value up to 
>   256 characters long. Specifying metadata for a message is optional.
> The response body of a successful POST request to the messages endpoint will include a ```messages```
> property which contains a list of all messages submitted. The list of messages submitted will
> reflect the list of messages included in the request, but each message will also contain two new
> properties, ```message_id``` and ```status```. The returned message ID will be a 36 character UUID
> which can be used to check the status of the message via the Get Message Status endpoint. The status
> of the message which reflect the status of the message at submission time which will always be
> ```queued```. See the Delivery Reports section of this documentation for more information on message
> statues.
> *Note: when sending multiple messages in a request, all messages must be valid for the request to be successful.
> If any messages in the request are invalid, no messages will be sent.*

> Each reply will contain details about the reply message, as well as details of the message the reply was sent
> in response to, including any metadata specified. Every reply will have a reply ID to be used with the
> confirm replies endpoint.
> *Note: The source number and destination number properties in a reply are the inverse of those
> specified in the message the reply is in response to. The source number of the reply message is the
> same as the destination number of the original message, and the destination number of the reply
> message is the same as the source number of the original message. If a source number
> wasn't specified in the original message, then the destination number property will not be present
> in the reply message.*
> Subsequent requests to the check replies endpoint will return the same reply messages and a maximum
> of 100 replies will be returned in each request. Applications should use the confirm replies endpoint
> in the following pattern so that replies that have been processed are no longer returned in
> subsequent check replies requests.
> 1. Call check replies endpoint
> 2. Process each reply message
> 3. Confirm all processed reply messages using the confirm replies endpoint
> *Note: It is recommended to use the Webhooks feature to receive reply messages rather than polling
> the check replies endpoint.*

### <a name="confirm_replies_as_received"></a>![Method: ](https://apidocs.io/img/method.png ".RepliesController.confirmRepliesAsReceived") confirmRepliesAsReceived

> Mark a reply message as confirmed so it is no longer returned in check replies requests.
> The confirm replies endpoint is intended to be used in conjunction with the check replies endpoint
> to allow for robust processing of reply messages. Once one or more reply messages have been processed
> they can then be confirmed using the confirm replies endpoint so they are no longer returned in
> subsequent check replies requests.
> The confirm replies endpoint takes a list of reply IDs as follows:
> ```json
> {
>     "reply_ids": [
>         "011dcead-6988-4ad6-a1c7-6b6c68ea628d",
>         "3487b3fa-6586-4979-a233-2d1b095c7718",
>         "ba28e94b-c83d-4759-98e7-ff9c7edb87a1"
>     ]
> }
> ```
> Up to 100 replies can be confirmed in a single confirm replies request.
